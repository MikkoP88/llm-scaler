# 01. System Hang During Ubuntu 25.04 Installation with B60 Card Plugged In
The issue is caused by an outdated GPU GuC firmware bundled in the official Ubuntu 25.04 Desktop ISO image.

Workaround: Remove the B60 card before starting the Ubuntu installation, and plug it back in once the installation is complete.
We are also working with the Ubuntu team to address this issue upstream.

# 02. Limited 33 GB/s Bi-Directional P2P Bandwidth with 1x GPU Card
When using a single GPU card over a x16 PCIe connection without a PCIe switch, the observed bi-directional P2P bandwidth is limited to 33 GB/s.

Workaround: Change the PCIe slot configuration in BIOS from Auto/x16 to x8/x8.
With this change, over 40 GB/s bi-directional P2P bandwidth can be achieved.
Root cause analysis is still in progress.

# 03. Un-clean vLLM Shutdown (kill -9 / crash / docker rm -f) Wedges the xe Driver Until Host Reboot
Killing a vLLM XPU worker while a kernel is in flight (SIGKILL, OOM kill,
`docker rm -f`, engine crash) leaves a no-timeout job on the engine. The xe
driver can only reclaim it with an engine reset (`dmesg`: "Engine reset:
engine_class=ccs" + Xe devcoredump "Reason: LR job cleanup"), and that reset
silently breaks whatever process is live on the engine at that moment. The
next vLLM instance then hangs forever at its first device operation and
spams `shm_broadcast.py: No available shared memory broadcast block found in
60 seconds` (observed both at first request and mid-generation on long
contexts).

There is no in-host recovery: a sysfs FLR (`echo 1 > /sys/class/drm/cardN/
device/reset`) disables the mei_gsc firmware and makes both cards
unusable (`No XPU devices are available`). Only a host reboot clears it.

Workarounds:
- Stop instances gracefully (`docker stop` / Ctrl-C, ~10 s grace) so the
  worker drain hook (`torch.xpu.synchronize()` + `empty_cache()` at exit)
  can finish in-flight kernels. Do not use `kill -9` / `docker rm -f` on a
  running server.
- After any crash or hard kill, reboot the host before starting a new
  vLLM instance. vLLM now probes the device at startup
  (`VLLM_XPU_STARTUP_PROBE_TIMEOUT_S`, default 60 s) and fails fast with
  this guidance instead of hanging; the worker step watchdog
  (`VLLM_WORKER_STEP_TIMEOUT_S`, default 600 s on XPU) bounds mid-run
  hangs the same way.
- Note: the AI host gets a NEW DHCP IP on every reboot (observed roaming
  10.20.3.44 -> .45 -> .46). If the last known IP stops answering after a
  reboot, probe the next IPs (+1) before assuming the host is down.
